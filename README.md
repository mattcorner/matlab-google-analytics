# matlab-google-analytics

Google Analytics allows web and application developers to track user behaviour to better focus their attention on development that makes a difference for their users. This toolbox opens up this functionality to matlab developers by using the measurement protocol api provided by Google.

Currently developers can log pageviews and events, as well as user system information such as matlab version, toolbox version, screen resolution, operating system, etc...

Future improvements:
- Enable asynchronous logging
- Enable other hit types
- Enable custom variables
